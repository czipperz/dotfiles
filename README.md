# dotfiles

My dotfiles. The install script takes a basic Arch Linux setup (rebooted, just `base` and `base-devel` installed) and sets it up to my standard.

Directories are self explanatory.

##Installation

**FOR ARCH LINUX ONLY**

	cd $HOME
	git clone 'https://github.com/czipperz/dotfiles'
	cd dotfiles
	./install

Non arch version coming soon
